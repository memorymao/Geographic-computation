        "###### This task is a pause-reflect-and-improve code refactoring practice. You are required to restructure your code from the first two assignments and to improve its internal structure and non-functional features. Specifically, you are encouraged to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* discover, design, and create potentially reusable functions for your code.\n",
        "* rewrite some of the code to make it more concise and more efficient using techniques like comprehensions.\n",
        "  * list comprehensions\n",
        "  * dictionary comprehensions\n",
        "  * set comprehensions\n",
        "  * generator expressions\n",
        "* Add necessary comments and documentation to explain the logic and key steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that do not overdo it. For example, comprehensions are just a different form of for loops. Code looks very concise with comprehensions, but could be hard to understand. Comments are also very helpful, but the main body of a program file should be code, not explanatory text. Or the code should be self-explanatory. Overall, we need to strike a balance between being (syntax) efficient and being comprehensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "For those who are still behind the schedule, this is an opportunity to catch up. For those who have finished all the assignments, this is where you can try alternative approaches and gain a higher-level perspective on programming and code structure."
